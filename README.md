### Introduction
The objective of this project was to analyze data from a food delivery app and create a table called "zomato" in the database using phpMyAdmin. The project utilized Python, SQL, and Excel for data analysis, while phpMyAdmin was utilized for database queries, and Jupyter Notebook was utilized for data analysis. This project was completed within a week as part of the HiCounselor real-world project program.

Aside from analyzing a real-world database using SQL, this project also provides practical experience in pre-processing data using Python to ensure optimal performance. It also highlights the value of structured query language in retrieving valuable information from databases. Additionally, this project served as an opportunity to collaborate effectively with team members.

### Technologies & Tools Used

The following tools were used in the completion of this project:
